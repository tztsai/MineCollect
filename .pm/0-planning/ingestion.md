‚∏ª

üß† PHASE 1 SOURCES

Source	Value Type	Access Method	Frequency	Persistence Strategy
ChatGPT	Conversations & ideas	Browser automation or export	Daily	Auto-login with cookies/session
Readwise	Highlights, articles	Official API (well-designed)	Hourly	API key + sync cursor
Kindle	Book highlights	Readwise API / clippings.txt	Daily	File watcher (clippings.txt), or Readwise
YouTube	Watch history, likes, playlists	YouTube Data API + cookies	Hourly	OAuth2 or cookies
Twitter/X	Bookmarks, likes, threads	Scraping + cookies (no API)	Hourly	Puppeteer with login
Screenshots	Visual notes	File watcher on folders	Realtime	Local sync agent
Obsidian	Markdown notes & backlinks	File watcher on vault	Realtime	Local sync
GitHub Stars	Interest graph (repos/tools)	GitHub API	Hourly	OAuth token
Zotero	Academic PDFs + notes	Local storage or API	Hourly	Zotero web API or local DB parse

‚∏ª

üîß INTEGRATION STRATEGY

1. Authentication & Access

Source	Strategy
ChatGPT	Headless browser (e.g. Puppeteer/Playwright), persistent cookies
Readwise	Use stable REST API with sync cursors
Kindle	Monitor My Clippings.txt or use Readwise integration
YouTube	YouTube Data API with OAuth or cookies for private data
Twitter/X	Puppeteer + session cookie to extract Bookmarks/Threads
Screenshots	OS-level folder watchers (macOS/Windows/Linux)
Obsidian	Watch .md file changes, parse backlinks
GitHub	Personal access token, REST API
Zotero	Access local SQLite DB (zotero.sqlite) or use Web API


‚∏ª

2. Ingestion Mechanisms

Use a plugin architecture:
	‚Ä¢	Each source has a collector module with a fetch() and diff() method.
	‚Ä¢	Collectors feed into a universal ingestion queue, with content stored as raw + parsed formats.

/src
  /collectors
    twitter.js
    youtube.js
    readwise.js
    ...
  /storage
    postgres.ts
    blobstore.ts
  /parser
    extract_text.ts
    dedupe.ts


‚∏ª

3. Storage Architecture

Option: SQLite or Postgres with:
	‚Ä¢	items table: id, source, type, content, metadata, created_at
	‚Ä¢	raw blobstore (e.g., media or raw HTML)
	‚Ä¢	tags, annotations, links, vectors (if enabling semantic search)

‚∏ª

4. Scheduler & Sync Engine
	‚Ä¢	Use a cron-style scheduler (e.g., node-cron, systemd timer) for batch syncs
	‚Ä¢	Real-time for file watchers (screenshots, Obsidian)
	‚Ä¢	Message queue (BullMQ or simple job queue) to coordinate syncs and retries

‚∏ª

5. Privacy & Persistence

Since this is personal-only:
	‚Ä¢	Store OAuth tokens, cookies in an encrypted local vault (~/.minecollect/secrets.json)
	‚Ä¢	Run as a background daemon with minecollect sync or Electron tray app

‚∏ª

6. UI Component for Status & Review

Basic dashboard:
	‚Ä¢	Source status: Last sync, new items count
	‚Ä¢	Review tab: Card-based or table UI
	‚Ä¢	Filter by source, date, type (text, audio, image)

‚∏ª

üìå EXAMPLE: Twitter Collector (Puppeteer)

// twitter.ts
async function fetchBookmarks(sessionCookies) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setCookie(...sessionCookies);
  await page.goto("https://twitter.com/i/bookmarks");
  const items = await scrapeBookmarks(page); // DOM parse
  return items.map(i => ({ source: "twitter", type: "bookmark", ...i }));
}


‚∏ª

üîê Authentication Vault Example

{
  "twitter": {
    "cookies": [...],
    "lastSync": "2025-06-08T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "readwise": {
    "apiKey": "READWISE_SECRET_KEY"
  },
  ...
}

üîÑ Summary: Build Order (Minimal but Powerful MVP)
	1.	Core Ingest Architecture: Queue + Storage + Schema
	2.	Implement First 5 Collectors:
	‚Ä¢	Readwise (API)
	‚Ä¢	Screenshots (File Watcher)
	‚Ä¢	Twitter (Puppeteer)
	‚Ä¢	ChatGPT (Browser automation + export JSON)
	‚Ä¢	Obsidian (Markdown parser)
	3.	Dashboard UI: Show sync status, search, and manual review
	4.	Add OCR + Tagging later for screenshot/image content
