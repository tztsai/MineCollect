MineCollect is an ambitious but immensely valuable project—essentially a universal content harvester for your digital footprint. For something this broad, you need a modular, extensible, and persistent data ingestion system that handles:
	1.	Authentication & Session Persistence (OAuth/cookies/passwords)
	2.	Connectors to each source
	3.	Data normalization
	4.	Storage and indexing
	5.	Monitoring and resilience

Here’s a professional recommendation with strong architectural thinking and specific technologies:

🧩 1. Connectors (Data Ingestion Layer)

Design each connector as an independent worker, potentially using a plugin-like structure.

Recommended Technologies:
	•	Python or Node.js workers – great for scripting scrapers and APIs.
	•	Playwright or Selenium – for UI scraping (e.g. WeChat).
	•	youtube-dl or yt-dlp – for YouTube metadata and downloads.
	•	snscrape – for scraping Twitter/X.
	•	Reddit API – or use PRAW.
	•	[Kindle highlights via Amazon or Readwise API]
	•	WeChat – extremely tricky; explore:
		•	WeChat for Web + Playwright automation
		•	Local storage folder scraping if using PC WeChat
	•	Zotero – use Zotero local DB or Zotero API

Authentication:
	•	Store OAuth tokens/passwords securely in a .env or config file
	•	Use keyring or encrypted vault like 1Password CLI or Hashicorp Vault for sensitive info
	•	Enable persistent sessions with cookies (pickle browser session cookies)

🧰 2. Data Normalization

Standardize all inputs into a unified JSON schema. Suggested fields:

{
  "source": "YouTube",
  "url": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "tags": ["..."],
  "content": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "metadata": {...}
}

Build a Normalizer interface per connector to convert raw data → unified schema.

⸻

🧠 3. Data Storage

You want fast access, searchability, and rich metadata.
	•	Primary DB: SQLite or PostgreSQL (depending on complexity)
	•	Full-text Search: Meilisearch (fast, lightweight) or Typesense
	•	File Storage: Store local copies (screenshots, PDFs, etc.) using a hashed folder structure.
	•	Object database (optional): Consider Weaviate or Chroma for semantic search later.

⸻

⏱ 4. Scheduler / Automation

Use a job scheduler to regularly sync data:
	•	cron + Airflow or Dagster – for more orchestration.
	•	Simple solution: Python’s schedule or Node’s node-cron

Each job can:
	•	Pull latest data
	•	Run normalizer
	•	Store to DB
	•	Log errors

⸻

🔍 5. UI / CLI / Monitoring
	•	CLI (initially): Rich TUI with Textual or Typer
	•	Minimal Dashboard: Build with Next.js or Astro for visualizing ingested data
	•	Logging & Alerting: Use Sentry or self-hosted logtail or Prometheus + Grafana if scaling.

⸻

🪢 6. Folder Watchers

For local folders (screenshots, Zotero folders, etc.):
	•	Use watchdog in Python or chokidar in Node.js
	•	Automatically extract text via OCR:
	•	Tesseract or EasyOCR
	•	Auto-tagging with ML/NLP (e.g. spaCy or OpenAI embeddings)

⸻

🧠 Optional Enhancements
	•	Tagging via ML models (zero-shot classification, sentence-transformers)
	•	Embeddings + Vector Search: OpenAI or local all-MiniLM → store in ChromaDB
	•	Semantic Deduplication (e.g., remove near-duplicate content)
	•	Attention-Based Prioritization: Rank items you’re likely to revisit or compose with.

⸻

♻️ Open Source Strategy
	•	License: AGPLv3 if you want copyleft, MIT/Apache-2 if you want community growth.
	•	Structure:
	•	/connectors – each web platform script
	•	/normalizers – platform-specific transformers
	•	/db – ORM models and schema
	•	/cli – commands
	•	/scheduler – cron/task runners
	•	/web – optional dashboard

🧭 Final Thoughts

This is not just a collector—it’s a foundational layer for a personal intelligence system, a local data lake for your mind. Prioritize modularity, extensibility, and schema coherence. Over-engineering upfront is dangerous—build a few reliable connectors first, then generalize.
